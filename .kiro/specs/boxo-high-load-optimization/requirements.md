# Boxo High Load Optimization Requirements

## Introduction

This specification describes the requirements for optimizing the Boxo library for efficient operation under high load as part of an IPFS-cluster. The optimization aims to improve performance, scalability, and system stability when processing large numbers of concurrent requests and data operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Bitswap Optimization for High Throughput

**User Story:** As an IPFS-cluster administrator, I want Bitswap to efficiently handle thousands of concurrent block requests, so that the cluster can serve a large number of clients without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives more than 1000 concurrent block requests THEN Bitswap SHALL maintain response time under 100ms for 95% of requests
2. WHEN load exceeds 10000 requests per second THEN the system SHALL automatically scale connection pools
3. WHEN peak load occurs THEN the system SHALL prioritize critically important requests
4. IF memory exceeds 80% of available THEN the system SHALL activate cache eviction mechanisms

### Requirement 2: Blockstore Optimization for Bulk Operations

**User Story:** As an application developer, I want the blockstore to efficiently handle bulk read and write operations, so that my application can quickly synchronize large volumes of data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing batch writes of more than 1000 blocks THEN the system SHALL use transactional operations to improve performance
2. WHEN concurrent reading of multiple blocks occurs THEN the system SHALL group requests to optimize I/O
3. IF block size exceeds 1MB THEN the system SHALL use streaming processing
4. WHEN block cache is full THEN the system SHALL use LRU algorithm with access frequency consideration

### Requirement 3: Network Layer Optimization for Cluster Environment

**User Story:** As a cluster operator, I want network connections between cluster nodes to be optimized to minimize latency and maximize throughput.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN establishing connections between cluster nodes THEN the system SHALL use persistent connection pools
2. WHEN high latency is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically switch to alternative routes
3. IF connection is idle for more than 30 seconds THEN the system SHALL send keep-alive packets
4. WHEN throughput drops below threshold THEN the system SHALL adaptively adjust buffer sizes

### Requirement 4: Performance Monitoring and Metrics

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to receive detailed performance metrics in real-time, so that I can quickly identify and resolve bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL export metrics through Prometheus endpoint
2. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL generate alerts with detailed diagnostics
3. IF response time exceeds SLA THEN the system SHALL log request tracing
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide structured logs with context

### Requirement 5: Memory and Resource Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to efficiently manage memory and prevent leaks during long-term operation under load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs for more than 24 hours under load THEN memory consumption SHALL NOT increase by more than 5%
2. WHEN memory limit is reached THEN the system SHALL activate graceful degradation
3. IF memory leak is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically restart problematic components
4. WHEN load decreases THEN the system SHALL release unused resources

### Requirement 6: Configurability and Tuning

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to be able to fine-tune performance parameters for different load scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration parameters change THEN the system SHALL apply them without restart
2. WHEN new load pattern is detected THEN the system SHALL suggest optimal settings
3. IF configuration is incorrect THEN the system SHALL validate parameters and warn about errors
4. WHEN system operates in different environments THEN it SHALL automatically adapt default settings

### Requirement 7: Fault Tolerance Under High Load

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the system to maintain stability and continue serving critically important requests even under extreme load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN load exceeds design capacity THEN the system SHALL apply circuit breaker pattern
2. WHEN one cluster node is unavailable THEN the system SHALL automatically redistribute load
3. IF cascading failure occurs THEN the system SHALL isolate problematic components
4. WHEN system recovers from failure THEN it SHALL gradually increase load
